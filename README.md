I love to learn developing my skills of programming because it is my unrealized passion yet. I have some theoretical experience, but a very little practical one. 

Motorola Academy is a dream come true for me Under the guidance of experienced mentors, I could finally fulfill my dreams - become a better developer and shortly work as a full-stack developer.
